# IF Apps

## About the Project
The project aims to develop an Android application called IF Apps to streamline various academic tasks currently managed through email, student portals, and direct communication with faculty.
The current manual processes are deemed inefficient and time-consuming, prompting the need for a centralized system.
IF Apps will provide functionalities such as accessing department announcements, scheduling meetings between students and lecturers, and verifying course prerequisites.
This application aims to enhance efficiency and convenience in managing academic interactions and administrative tasks within the university context.
There are three roles and their features are:
1. System Administrator: Manage announcements and it's tags.
2. Lecturer: Add available time slots for invitations.
3. Student: View enrolled course for past semesters and add course enrollment in active semester.

General features for all roles: 
- View and search announcement.
- View and manage personal meetings and invitations.
- View profile information.

> This is the final project for the "Mobile Programming" course.
